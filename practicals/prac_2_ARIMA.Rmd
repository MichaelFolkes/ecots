## Introduction

In this practical you will:

- Fit a basic ARIMA model to the `airquality` data
- See if we can beat it with some of the other methods available through forecast
- Quantify the accuracy of each method

As yesterday, you should work your way through the questions and put your hand up if you get stuck. The answer script is also available in the practicals folder.
